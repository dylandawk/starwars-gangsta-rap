Star Wars Ep. 4 Generated Rap
===========================

This project uses text analysis to generate raps from the script of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and text scraping of [a list of rap Ad lib lines](https://genius.com/Rap-genius-ad-libs-explained-lyrics).

It works by generating  four couplets (rhyming pairs) and an ad lib line per couplet.  The rapper and ad libber are randomly assigned from a list of characters in the original script. 

I hope you have fun rapping to some of the greatest lines in cinematic history! :)
